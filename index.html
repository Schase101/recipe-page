  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 cups finely ground almonds</li>
  <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li> 
  <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>teaspoon ground cloves</li> 
  <li> ⅛ cups unsalted butter</1i> 
  <li>4 egg yolks, divided</li>
  <li>6 tablespoons red currant jam </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Place flour, ground almonds, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and cloves on a clean work surface. 
    Add butter and 2 egg yolks; knead quickly to form a smooth dough. 
    Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan with remaining 1 tablespoon butter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press 2/3 of the dough evenly in the pan so that the entire bottom is covered. 
    Spread red currant jam on top. Divide remaining dough into several pieces and roll into 1/3-inch strands. 
    Arrange strips over the jam in a neat lattice pattern. Place the last strip along the sides to form a rim.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat remaining 2 egg yolks and brush over the lattice and rim, taking care not to splash onto the jam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes. 
    Watch carefully towards the end of baking so the torte does not turn too dark. 
    Let cool and remove gently from the pan.
  </li>
</ol>
